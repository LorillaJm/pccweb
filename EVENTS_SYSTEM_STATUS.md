## ✅ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

All components of the QR-based event ticketing system have been successfully implemented and tested. The system is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, security features, and performance optimizations.

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Backend Service Fixes
1. **✅ NotificationService Integration**: Fixed method calls to use correct service methods (`sendToUser` instead of `sendNotification`)
2. **✅ QRCode Library Import**: Added missing QRCode import in TicketService
3. **✅ Encryption Methods**: Updated crypto methods to use modern Node.js APIs (AES-256-CBC)
4. **✅ Unused Parameters**: Fixed unused `reason` parameter in ticket cancellation
5. **✅ Async/Await Issues**: Removed unnecessary await calls where not needed

### Frontend Component Fixes
1. **✅ UI Components**: Created all missing UI components (Card, Button, Badge, Input, etc.)
2. **✅ Utility Functions**: Added required utility functions (`cn` function for class merging)
3. **✅ Dependencies**: Updated package.json with all required dependencies
4. **✅ TypeScript Support**: Ensured proper TypeScript definitions for all components

### Database Schema Fixes
1. **⚠️ Index Warnings**: Minor duplicate index warnings (non-breaking, system works correctly)
2. **✅ Connection Handling**: Proper fallback mechanisms for Redis connection failures
