- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor service worker errors
- [ ] Track install rates
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Analyze Web Vitals data
- [ ] Review offline usage patterns
- [ ] Check push notification engagement
- [ ] Monitor bundle sizes

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Service Worker Issues**
   - Unregister service worker via DevTools
   - Clear all caches
   - Deploy fix
   - Force service worker update

2. **Performance Issues**

   - Revert to previous version
   - Investigate and fix
   - Redeploy

3. **Compatibility Issues**
   - Add feature detection
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Update browser support matrix
