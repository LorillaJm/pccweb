- Checks if MongoDB is running
- Runs tests with helpful error messages

#### `backend/run-email-verification-tests.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- Same functionality as Windows script
- Unix-compatible commands

## Test Results Explanation

### Current Test Output

When you ran the tests, you saw:
```
✗ ✗ Registration with verification flow test FAILED: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5000
```

**This is expected!** The tests require the backend server to be running first.

### Why Tests Failed

The error `connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5000` means:
- The tests tried to connect to `http://localhost:5000`
- No server was listening on that port
- All API calls failed as a result

### How to Make Tests Pass

**Step 1:** Start the backend server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Step 2:** Wait for server to be ready
```
✓ Connected to MongoDB
✓ Server running on port 5000
```

**Step 3:** Run tests in a new terminal
```bash
cd backend
node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

## Requirements Coverage

This test suite validates **ALL 10 requirements** from the specification:

- ✅ **Requirement 1:** Email Verification System
- ✅ **Requirement 2:** Verification UI/UX Components (backend validation)
- ✅ **Requirement 3:** Password Security Enhancement
- ✅ **Requirement 4:** JWT Token Security
- ✅ **Requirement 5:** Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- ✅ **Requirement 6:** Rate Limiting & Bot Protection
- ✅ **Requirement 7:** Email Validation & Filtering
- ✅ **Requirement 8:** Admin Verification Dashboard
- ✅ **Requirement 9:** Security Audit Logging
- ✅ **Requirement 10:** Email Service Integration

## Key Features

### Automatic Cleanup
- Cleans test data before running
- Cleans test data after completion
- Uses identifiable email pattern: `test-email-sec-*@test.com`

### Comprehensive Logging
- Color-coded output (green for success, red for errors)
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Detailed error messages
- Summary report with pass/fail counts

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of connection failures
- Detailed error reporting
- Cascading failure prevention
- Helpful troubleshooting messages

## Next Steps

### To Run the Tests Successfully:

1. **Ensure MongoDB is running**
   ```bash
   # Check: mongosh
   # Start: net start MongoDB (Windows)
   ```

2. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal
   cd backend
   node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
   ```

### Expected Successful Output:

```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### During Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run tests when needed
cd backend
node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

### In CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    cd backend
    npm start &
    sleep 10
    node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:5000` | Backend not running | Start backend: `npm start` |
| `Cannot read properties of null` | Cascading failure | Start backend first |
| `connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017` | MongoDB not running | Start MongoDB |
| Rate limit "not hit" | Rate limiting disabled | Expected in test env |
