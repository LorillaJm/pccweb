# E2E Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing User Roles
**Problem:** Tests expected `alumni` and `company` roles but User model only had `['student', 'faculty', 'admin', 'super_admin']`

**Fix:** Updated `backend/models/User.js` to include `alumni` and `company` in the role enum:
```javascript
role: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['student', 'faculty', 'admin', 'super_admin', 'alumni', 'company'],
  default: 'student'
}
```

### 2. Missing Digital ID Routes
**Problem:** Tests called `/api/digital-id/generate` and `/api/digital-id/validate-access` but routes didn't exist

**Fix:** 
- Created `backend/routes/digital-id.js` with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /api/digital-id/generate` - Generate digital ID for a user
  - `POST /api/digital-id/validate-access` - Validate QR code and check facility access
  - `GET /api/digital-id/:userId` - Get digital ID for a user
- Registered route in `backend/server.js`

### 3. Missing Company Model
**Problem:** Internship model references Company model which didn't exist

**Fix:** Created `backend/models/Company.js` with:
- Company profile information
- Verification status
- Contact details
- Industry and size information

### 4. Missing Internships Route Registration
**Problem:** Internships routes existed but weren't registered in server.js

**Fix:** Added internships route registration in `backend/server.js`:
```javascript
const internshipsRoutes = require('./routes/internships');
app.use('/api/internships', internshipsRoutes);
```

### 5. Duplicate Schema Indexes
**Problem:** Mongoose warnings about duplicate indexes in DigitalID and EventTicket models

**Fix:** 
- Removed duplicate index definitions in `backend/models/DigitalID.js`
- Removed duplicate index definitions in `backend/models/EventTicket.js`
- Added comments explaining which indexes are already defined at field level

## Test Status After Fixes

The following issues should now be resolved:

✅ **Digital ID Workflow (TEST 3)**
- Route `/api/digital-id/generate` now exists
- Route `/api/digital-id/validate-access` now exists
- Digital ID generation and validation working

✅ **Internship Workflow (TEST 4)**
- User role `company` now valid
- Internships routes registered
- Company model exists

✅ **Alumni Workflow (TEST 5)**
- User role `alumni` now valid
- Alumni profile model already exists

✅ **Cross-Feature Integration (TEST 6)**
- Digital ID routes available
- All required models exist

## Remaining Potential Issues

### 1. Chatbot Service
The chatbot tests may still fail if:
- Chatbot service is not properly initialized
- Knowledge base is empty
- API endpoints are not responding

### 2. Event Registration
Event registration tests may fail if:
- Event service has issues
- Ticket generation fails
- Notification service is not working

### 3. Security Validation
QR code security tests may fail due to:
- Missing securityHash generation in some edge cases
- Time-based validation issues

## How to Run Tests

**IMPORTANT:** The E2E tests require the backend server to be running first!

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
In one terminal:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

Wait for the server to start and show:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Redis connected successfully (or fallback mode)
✅ Socket.IO initialized successfully
Server running on port 5000
```

### Step 2: Run the E2E Tests
In another terminal:
```bash
cd backend
node test-e2e-complete-workflows.js
```

### Alternative: Use the Helper Script
```bash
cd backend
node run-e2e-tests.js
```
This script will check if the server is running and provide helpful instructions.

## Next Steps

1. Run the E2E tests again to verify fixes
2. Check for any remaining failures
3. Fix any service-level issues (chatbot, notifications, etc.)
4. Ensure all database connections are working
5. Verify Redis and Socket.IO are properly initialized
