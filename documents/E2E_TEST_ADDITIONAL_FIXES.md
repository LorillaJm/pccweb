# E2E Test Additional Fixes

## Issue: Missing Required Fields in Test Data

After starting the server and running the E2E tests, we discovered that the test was creating model instances without all required fields.

### Problem

The test file was creating `Internship` and `InternshipApplication` models directly without providing all required fields, causing validation errors:

```
Internship validation failed: createdBy: Path `createdBy` is required.
```

### Root Cause

The test was bypassing the API routes and creating models directly using `new Internship()` and `new InternshipApplication()`, which meant it had to provide ALL required fields that would normally be set by the service layer.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Added `createdBy` to Internship Creation

**Location:** `backend/test-e2e-complete-workflows.js` (2 occurrences)

**Before:**
```javascript
const internship = new Internship({
  companyId: companyRep._id,
  title: 'E2E Test Internship - Software Developer',
  // ... other fields
  status: 'published'
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const internship = new Internship({
  companyId: companyRep._id,
  title: 'E2E Test Internship - Software Developer',
  // ... other fields
  status: 'published',
  createdBy: companyRep._id  // ✅ Added required field
});
```

#### 2. Added `studentInfo` to InternshipApplication Creation

**Location:** `backend/test-e2e-complete-workflows.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const application = new InternshipApplication({
  internshipId: internship._id,
  studentId: user._id,
  coverLetter: 'E2E integration test application',
  resume: 'test-resume.pdf',
  status: 'submitted'
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const application = new InternshipApplication({
  internshipId: internship._id,
  studentId: user._id,
  coverLetter: 'E2E integration test application',
  resume: 'test-resume.pdf',
  status: 'submitted',
  studentInfo: {  // ✅ Added required nested object
    currentYear: 4,
    program: 'Computer Science',
    expectedGraduation: new Date(Date.now() + 180 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    skills: ['Testing', 'JavaScript']
  }
});
```

### Why This Matters

When creating models directly in tests (instead of through API routes):
- You must provide ALL required fields
- You must provide nested required objects (like `studentInfo`)
- You don't get the automatic field population that services provide
- Validation happens immediately on `save()`

### Files Modified

- `backend/test-e2e-complete-workflows.js` - Added missing required fields to test data

### Testing

After these fixes, the Internship workflow test should progress further:
- ✅ Test users created
- ✅ Internship posting created
- ✅ Application submitted
- Next steps: Review, shortlist, interview, accept

### Related Documentation

- See `E2E_TEST_FIXES.md` for the initial route and model fixes
- See `RUN_E2E_TESTS.md` for how to run the tests
- See `E2E_TESTS_QUICK_GUIDE.md` for quick reference

### Lesson Learned

When writing E2E tests that create models directly:
1. Check the model schema for ALL required fields
2. Include nested required objects
3. Provide realistic test data
4. Consider using factory functions to create test data consistently

### Next Steps

Run the tests again to see if there are any other validation errors:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server should already be running
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Run tests
cd backend
node test-e2e-complete-workflows.js
```

Or use the helper:
```bash
cd backend
node run-e2e-tests.js
```
