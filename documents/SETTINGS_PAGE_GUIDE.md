# Settings Page - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Settings page is fully functional!**
- Location: `http://localhost:3000/portal/student/settings`
- All client-side features work immediately
- No backend required for appearance settings

## ⚠️ About the Timeout Error

The timeout error you're seeing is from the **subjects page**, not the settings page:
```
AxiosError: timeout of 15000ms exceeded
at /subjects/enrolled
```

This happens when:
1. You're not logged in
2. Session expired
3. Backend is slow to respond

**This does NOT affect the settings page functionality!**
