# Rate Limit Still Active - Here's What to Do

## The Situation

The rate limit was set at: **2025-10-20T04:47:35.719Z**  
You need to wait: **~57 minutes** (3396 seconds) OR clear it manually

## Option 1: Clear Rate Limits Manually (RECOMMENDED)

Run this command to clear all rate limits:

```bash
cd backend
node clear-rate-limits.js
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

## Option 2: Wait for Rate Limit to Expire

Wait until **04:47 AM** (about 57 minutes from when you ran the test), then run tests again.

## Option 3: Use Redis CLI Directly

If the clear script doesn't work, use Redis CLI:

```bash
# Connect to Redis
redis-cli

# In Redis CLI, run:
KEYS ratelimit:*
# This will show all rate limit keys

# Delete all rate limit keys:
EVAL "return redis.call('del', unpack(redis.call('keys', 'ratelimit:*')))" 0

# Or delete them one by one:
DEL ratelimit:register:YOUR_IP
DEL ratelimit:login:YOUR_IP
# etc.

# Exit Redis CLI
exit
```

## Why This Happened

1. You ran tests or manually tested the registration endpoint multiple times
2. The rate limiter stored these attempts in Redis
3. The rate limit window is 1 hour for registration
4. The clear function in the test couldn't find the keys (Redis SCAN issue)

## The Fix I Just Applied

I've updated both:
- `backend/test-email-verification-security-integration.js` - Better Redis key clearing
- `backend/clear-rate-limits.js` - Uses SCAN instead of KEYS

## Run This Now

```bash
cd backend

# Clear rate limits
node clear-rate-limits.js

# Run tests
node test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

This should work now!
