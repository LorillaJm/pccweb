## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Context Providers:
- `ThemeContext`: Manages theme, font size, language
- `SettingsContext`: Manages notifications and privacy

### Storage:
- All settings saved to `localStorage`
- Automatic persistence
- No backend required for basic functionality

### Dark Mode Classes:
- Uses Tailwind's `dark:` prefix
- Applied to all components
- Smooth transitions

## 🚀 Next Steps

To make it even better:
1. Add backend API endpoints for syncing settings
2. Implement i18n for language switching
3. Add more theme options (custom colors)
4. Add accessibility settings (high contrast, reduced motion)
5. Add notification sound preferences
