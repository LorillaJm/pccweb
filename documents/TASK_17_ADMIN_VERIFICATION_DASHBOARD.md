2. Start backend server
3. Navigate to /admin/verifications
4. Test all features with real data
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Admin Only Access:**
   - Route should be protected with admin middleware
   - Only admin users can access this dashboard

2. **Action Confirmation:**
   - All admin actions require confirmation
   - Prevents accidental modifications

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - All admin actions are logged
   - IP addresses recorded
   - Timestamps for accountability

4. **Data Privacy:**
   - Sensitive user data handled securely
   - No passwords displayed
   - Limited personal information shown

## 📊 Performance

- ✅ Pagination for large datasets
- ✅ Efficient API calls
- ✅ Debounced search (on Enter key)
- ✅ Minimal re-renders
- ✅ Lazy loading ready
- ✅ Optimized queries

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Task 18:** Update Registration Form with reCAPTCHA
2. **Task 19:** Update Login Flow UI with 2FA
3. **Backend:** Ensure Task 14 (Admin endpoints) is complete

### Integration Steps:
1. Add route protection (admin only)
2. Test with real backend API
3. Add to admin navigation menu
4. Test all admin actions
5. Verify audit logging

### Enhancement Ideas:
1. Export logs to CSV
2. Bulk actions (verify multiple users)
3. Email templates preview
4. User activity timeline
5. Advanced analytics dashboard
6. Real-time notifications for admin actions
