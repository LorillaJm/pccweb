# Authentication Error Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

Fixed multiple 401 (Unauthorized) errors that were appearing in the console when users weren't logged in.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Chatbot Hook (`src/hooks/useChatbot.ts`)
**Issue:** Chatbot was trying to fetch conversation history for unauthenticated users

**Fix:**
- Added graceful handling for 401 errors in `getConversationHistory`
- Now silently logs and returns instead of throwing error
- Added user-friendly error message in `sendMessage` for 401 errors

```typescript
// Before: Threw error for all non-OK responses
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

// After: Gracefully handles 401 for guest users
if (!response.ok) {
  if (response.status === 401) {
    console.log('User not authenticated - conversation history unavailable');
    return;
  }
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}
```

### 2. API Interceptor (`src/lib/api.ts`)
**Issue:** All API errors were being logged to console, including expected 401s

**Fix:**
- Updated response interceptor to suppress 401 error logs
- 401 errors are expected when not authenticated, so no need to log them
- Other errors still logged for debugging

```typescript
// Don't log 401 errors as they're expected when not authenticated
if (error.response.status !== 401) {
  console.log('API Error Response:', { ... });
}
```

### 3. Student Portal (`src/app/portal/student/page.tsx`)
**Issue:** Dashboard was trying to fetch data even when not authenticated

**Fix:**
- Added authentication check before fetching data
- Early return if user is not authenticated
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

```typescript
const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  // Don't fetch if not authenticated
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    setIsLoadingDashboard(false);
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of fetch logic
};
```

### 4. Faculty Portal (`src/app/portal/faculty/page.tsx`)
**Issue:** Same as student portal - fetching data without auth check

**Fix:**
- Added `isAuthenticated` and `authLoading` from useAuth
- Updated useEffect to only fetch when authenticated
- Added early return in fetchDashboardData

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading && isAuthenticated) {
    fetchDashboardData();
  }
}, [authLoading, isAuthenticated]);
```

## ✅ Results

### Before
- ❌ Console errors for unauthenticated users
- ❌ Unnecessary API calls
- ❌ Confusing error messages
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After
- ✅ No console errors for expected auth failures
- ✅ API calls only made when authenticated
- ✅ Clear error messages when needed
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Cleaner console logs

## 🎯 Impact

### User Experience
- No scary console errors for guest users
- Faster page loads (fewer failed API calls)
- Clear messaging when authentication is required

### Developer Experience
- Cleaner console logs
- Easier debugging (only real errors shown)
- Better error handling patterns

### Performance
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Lower server load
- Faster client-side rendering

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases
1. ✅ Visit site as guest user - no console errors
2. ✅ Visit student portal without login - graceful handling
3. ✅ Visit faculty portal without login - graceful handling
4. ✅ Use chatbot without login - clear error message
5. ✅ Login and use features - everything works normally

### Expected Behavior

**As Guest User:**
- No 401 errors in console
- Pages load normally
- Public content accessible
- Clear prompts to log in for protected features

**As Authenticated User:**
- All features work normally
- Data loads correctly
- No authentication errors
- Full portal access

## 📝 Notes

These fixes are **defensive programming** - handling expected error cases gracefully rather than treating them as exceptions. 401 errors are not bugs when a user isn't logged in; they're expected behavior.
