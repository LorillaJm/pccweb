## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Apple-Style Aesthetics**
- Clean, minimal interface
- Generous white space
- Subtle shadows and depth
- Premium feel with attention to detail

### 2. **Glassmorphism**
- `backdrop-blur-sm` effects
- Semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-white/80`)
- Layered depth with borders

### 3. **Smooth Animations**
- Framer Motion for all interactions
- Staggered card appearances
- Hover lift effects (y: -8, scale: 1.02)
- Tab morphing with `layoutId`
- Modal entrance/exit animations

### 4. **Color Gradients**
- Hero backgrounds with HeroMorph
- Button gradients
- Text gradients with `bg-clip-text`
- Consistent theme per page

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm, md, lg
- Grid layouts: 1 → 2 → 3 columns
- Adaptive typography
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
```typescript
- HeroMorph (animated backgrounds)
- PageTransition (page-level transitions)
- motion from Framer Motion (all animations)
- AnimatePresence (enter/exit animations)
- Lucide Icons (modern icon set)
```

### Animation Patterns
```typescript
// Card entrance
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: index * 0.1 }}

// Hover effect
whileHover={{ y: -8, scale: 1.02 }}

// Button interaction
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
```

### Color System
```css
/* Internships */
from-blue-600 via-indigo-600 to-purple-600

/* Alumni */
from-purple-600 via-pink-600 to-indigo-600

/* Backgrounds */
from-slate-50 via-[theme]-50/30 to-indigo-50/20
```
