## ✅ Task Completed: Verify Reduced Motion Fallbacks

**Task ID:** 16.2  
**Requirements:** 6.1, 6.4  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-10-18

---

## 📋 Task Objectives

- [x] Test all pages with prefers-reduced-motion enabled
- [x] Ensure all animations have static fallbacks
- [x] Verify functionality remains intact without animations
- [x] Document verification process and results

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive Code Review ✅

Reviewed and verified all animation components:
- ✅ `useReducedMotion` hook - Correctly detects motion preference
- ✅ `MotionProvider` - Properly exposes motion context
- ✅ `MotionWrapper` - Implements conditional rendering
- ✅ `PageTransition` - Has reduced motion variants
- ✅ `HeroMorph` - Provides static gradient fallback
- ✅ `PremiumCard` - Uses subtle opacity changes
- ✅ `PremiumButton` - Disables ripple and scale
- ✅ `LoadingMask` - Simple fade instead of morph
