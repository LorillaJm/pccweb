## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure MongoDB is running
# Ensure Redis is running (optional, will use in-memory fallback)
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
# With Jest (if installed)
npm test backend/test-event-notifications-integration.js

# Simple test without Jest
node backend/test-event-notifications-simple.js
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Registration Confirmation:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/events/:eventId/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"additionalInfo": "Test registration"}'
```

2. **Test Reminder Scheduling:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/events/:eventId/schedule-reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

3. **Test Event Update:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/events/:eventId \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venue": "New Venue"}'
```

4. **Test Notification Settings:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/events/:eventId/notification-settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sendRegistrationConfirmation": true,
    "sendReminders": true,
    "reminderTimes": [48, 24, 2]
  }'
```

- Follow-up messages

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing
- Notifications processed in batches
- Prevents system overload
- Configurable batch size

### Caching
- User preferences cached in Redis
- Reduces database queries

- Asynchronous notification processing
- Queue-based job management
- Retry logic for failures

## Security

### Authorization
- Only event organizers can manage notifications
- Users can only update their own preferences
- Proper authentication required

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints are rate-limited
- Prevents notification spam
- Configurable limits

### Data Privacy
- User contact information protected
- Notification content sanitized
- Audit logs maintained

## Next Steps

The event notification system is now fully integrated and ready for use. To complete the remaining tasks:

1. **Task 9.2:** Integrate notifications with internship portal
2. **Task 9.3:** Connect notifications to alumni and access systems

Task 9.1 has been successfully completed with all required features implemented:
- ✅ Event registration and reminder notifications
- ✅ Event cancellation and update notifications
- ✅ Attendance confirmation and follow-up messages
- ✅ Event-specific notification preferences
- ✅ Comprehensive integration tests

The system is production-ready and follows best practices for notification management, user preferences, and system performance.
