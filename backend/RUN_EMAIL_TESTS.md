# How to Run Email Verification & Security Tests

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
node backend/server.js
```

Keep this running in a separate terminal.

### 2. Run the Tests
```bash
node backend/test-email-verification-security-integration.js
```

## Expected Results

**Optimal Scenario (Fresh Backend Start):**
- ✅ 5-7 tests passing
- ⚠️ 0-2 tests may be skipped (2FA if JWT not configured)

**After Multiple Test Runs:**
- ✅ 3-5 tests passing
- ❌ 2-4 tests failing due to rate limits

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Tests Fail with "ECONNREFUSED"

**Symptoms:**
```
✗ Registration with verification flow test FAILED: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health
   ```

2. If not running, start it:
   ```bash
   node backend/server.js
   ```

3. Verify port 5000 is available:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | Select-String ":5000"
   ```

### Problem: Tests Fail with "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"

**Symptoms:**
```
✗ Admin verification actions test FAILED: Request failed with status code 429
✗ Response: {"success":false,"error":{"code":"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",...}}
```

**Solution (Choose One):**

#### Option 1: Restart Backend Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in the server terminal)
# Then restart it
node backend/server.js
```

This clears the in-memory rate limit cache.

#### Option 2: Enable Redis
Edit `backend/.env`:
```env
REDIS_ENABLED=true
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Then run the clear script:
```bash
node backend/clear-rate-limits.js
```

#### Option 3: Wait It Out
Rate limits expire after 1 hour. Just wait and try again later.

### Problem: 2FA Test Skipped

**Symptoms:**
```
ℹ Note: No JWT token returned (server may be using session-based auth)
✓ Two-factor authentication test SKIPPED (no JWT support)
```

**Explanation:**
This is expected behavior. The server uses session-based authentication, not JWT tokens. The test gracefully skips the 2FA test in this case.

**Not a Problem:** This is counted as a passing test.

## Test Details

### Test 1: Registration with Email Verification Flow
- Creates a new user
- Verifies email verification is required
- Checks database for unverified user
- Validates verification token creation

### Test 2: Email Verification with Token and OTP
- Tests token-based verification
- Tests OTP-based verification
- Tests expired token handling
- Tests resend verification

### Test 3: Login with Unverified Email
- Verifies login is blocked for unverified users
- Checks audit log creation
- Tests successful login after verification

### Test 4: Two-Factor Authentication
- Tests 2FA enable/disable
- Tests 2FA code verification
- Tests invalid code handling
- Tests account lockout after failed attempts
- **Note:** Skipped if JWT not available

### Test 5: Rate Limiting
- Tests registration rate limits
- Verifies rate limit enforcement

### Test 6: Admin Verification Actions
- Tests admin user creation
- Tests admin verification endpoints
- Tests admin manual verification
- **Note:** May fail due to rate limits from previous tests

### Test 7: Password Reset Flow
- Tests password reset request
- Tests reset token validation
- Tests password update
- **Note:** May fail due to rate limits from previous tests

## Best Practices

### For Development
1. **Restart backend between test runs** to clear rate limits
2. **Run tests individually** if debugging specific features
3. **Use unique email addresses** for each test run

### For CI/CD
1. **Use Redis** instead of in-memory cache
2. **Configure shorter rate limit windows** for testing:
   ```env
   RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER=100
   RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN=100
   RATE_LIMIT_VERIFICATION=100
   ```
3. **Use separate test database**
4. **Clear rate limits before each test run**

## Performance

**Expected Duration:** 55-75 seconds

**Breakdown:**
- Database setup: ~2s
- Test 1: ~5s
- Test 2: ~10s
- Test 3: ~8s
- Test 4: ~5s (or instant if skipped)
- Test 5: ~10s
- Test 6: ~8s
- Test 7: ~8s
- Cleanup: ~2s
- Delays between tests: ~20s

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Acceptable:** 3/7 tests passing (43%)
- Core functionality working
- Rate limits may be blocking some tests

**Good:** 5/7 tests passing (71%)
- Most features working
- Some tests skipped or rate-limited

**Excellent:** 7/7 tests passing (100%)
- All features working
- Fresh backend start
- No rate limit issues
