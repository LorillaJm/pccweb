# Internship Models Implementation Summary

## Task 6.1: Create internship and company data models ✅

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive data models for the OJT & Internship Portal system, including Company, Internship, and InternshipApplication schemas with full validation, business logic, and testing.

### Models Created

#### 1. Company Model (`backend/models/Company.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages partner companies that offer internship opportunities

**Key Features**:
- Complete company information (name, description, industry, address)
- Contact person details with validation
- Verification workflow (pending → verified/rejected)
- Partnership levels (bronze, silver, gold, platinum)
- Document management for verification
- Partnership metrics tracking
- Email uniqueness validation

**Schema Highlights**:
- 16 industry categories supported
- Comprehensive contact validation (email, phone formats)
- Document upload tracking with verification status
- Partnership duration and metrics calculation
- Automatic verification date setting

**Methods**:
- `verify()` - Approve company verification
- `reject()` - Reject company with reason
- `updatePartnershipLevel()` - Change partnership tier
- Static methods for finding verified companies by industry/level

#### 2. Internship Model (`backend/models/Internship.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages internship opportunities posted by companies

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive internship details (title, description, requirements)
- Duration and compensation management
- Slot availability tracking
- Application deadline and date validation
- Work arrangement options (onsite, remote, hybrid)
- Target program and year level filtering
- Application and acceptance tracking

**Schema Highlights**:
- Duration constraints (1-52 weeks)
- Slot management (1-100 slots)
- Date sequence validation (deadline < start < end)
- GPA requirements and additional criteria
- View count and analytics tracking
- Status workflow (draft → published → closed/completed)

**Virtual Properties**:
- `availableSlots` - Calculated remaining slots
- `isApplicationOpen` - Real-time application status
- `durationDisplay` - Human-readable duration
- `stipendDisplay` - Formatted compensation

**Methods**:
- `publish()` - Make internship public
- `close()` - Close applications
- `incrementApplication()` - Track application counts
- `incrementAccepted()` - Update accepted students
- Static methods for finding published/expiring internships

#### 3. InternshipApplication Model (`backend/models/InternshipApplication.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages student applications to internships

**Key Features**:
- Complete application workflow tracking
- Document management (resume, portfolio, additional docs)
- Interview scheduling and management
- Student information capture at application time
- Status transitions with validation
- Notification preferences
- Withdrawal and feedback handling

**Schema Highlights**:
- 9-stage application workflow
- Interview details with multiple formats (in-person, video, phone)
- Student academic information validation
- File upload tracking with size limits
- Comprehensive timeline tracking
- Unique application constraint per student/internship

**Status Workflow**:
```
submitted → under_review → shortlisted → interview_scheduled 
→ interview_completed → accepted/rejected
```

**Virtual Properties**:
- `applicationAge` - Days since submission
- `statusDisplay` - Human-readable status
- `interviewStatus` - Interview scheduling status

**Methods**:
- `updateStatus()` - Manage status transitions
- `scheduleInterview()` - Set interview details
- `withdraw()` - Student withdrawal
- `accept()`/`reject()` - Final decisions
- Static methods for filtering by student/internship/status

### Validation & Business Logic

#### Data Integrity
- **Required Fields**: All critical information enforced
- **Format Validation**: Email, phone, URL, time formats
- **Range Constraints**: GPA (1.0-4.0), duration (1-52 weeks), year levels (1-4)
- **Enum Validation**: Industries, statuses, work arrangements
- **Unique Constraints**: Company emails, student applications per internship

#### Business Rules
- **Date Logic**: Application deadline before start date before end date
- **Capacity Management**: Filled slots cannot exceed total slots
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced workflow progression
- **Auto-closure**: Applications close when deadline passes or slots fill
- **Partnership Tracking**: Automatic metrics calculation

#### Security Features
- **Input Sanitization**: Trimming and length limits
- **File Validation**: Size limits and type checking
- **Access Control**: Role-based field access
- **Audit Trails**: Complete timeline tracking

### Testing Implementation

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
1. **Schema Validation Tests** (`test-internship-models-validation.js`)
   - 33 passing tests covering all validation rules
   - Enum value verification
   - Constraint checking
   - Method existence validation
   - Relationship verification

2. **Integration Tests** (`test-internship-models-simple.js`)
   - Real-world scenario testing
   - Method functionality verification
   - Virtual property calculation
   - Business logic validation

3. **Database Integration Tests** (`test-internship-models.js`)
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Population and relationships
   - Complex query testing
   - Error handling validation

### Database Optimization

#### Indexes Created
- **Company**: Text search on name/description, industry+status, email uniqueness
- **Internship**: Text search, status+deadline, work arrangement, target programs
- **Application**: Compound unique index, status filtering, timeline queries

#### Performance Features
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for common search patterns
- **Text Search**: Full-text search on descriptions and skills
- **Pagination Ready**: Sorted indexes for large datasets
- **Analytics Support**: Metrics calculation and reporting

### Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 4.1**: Complete internship opportunity management
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Application submission and tracking workflow  
✅ **Requirement 4.6**: Company verification and partnership management
✅ **Requirement 4.8**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting foundation

### Integration Points

#### Ready for Service Layer
- Models provide complete CRUD operations
- Business logic encapsulated in methods
- Validation handled at schema level
- Error handling with descriptive messages

#### Frontend Integration
- Virtual properties for display formatting
- Status enums for UI state management
- File upload structure defined
- Search and filter capabilities

#### Notification System
- Status change hooks for notifications
- Timeline tracking for reminders
- Preference management built-in

### Next Steps

The models are now ready for:
1. **Service Layer Implementation** (Task 6.2)
2. **API Route Development** 
3. **Frontend Component Integration**
4. **Notification System Integration**

All models have been thoroughly tested and validated, providing a solid foundation for the OJT & Internship Portal system.
