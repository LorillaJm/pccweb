## Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Job posting notifications sent in batches (default: 100 users)
   - Bulk expiry reminders processed efficiently
   - Prevents system overload

2. **Caching**

   - Contact information cached for quick access
   - Reduces database queries

3. **Asynchronous Delivery**
   - Notifications queued for background processing
   - Non-blocking notification sending
   - Retry mechanism for failed deliveries

4. **Channel Optimization**
   - Priority-based channel selection
   - User preference filtering
   - Quiet hours support

---

## Security Features

1. **Access Control**
   - Security team receives copies of high-priority alerts
   - Suspicious activity automatically flagged
   - Emergency lockdown notifications to all affected users

2. **Audit Trail**
   - All notifications logged with timestamps
   - Delivery status tracked per channel
   - Failed deliveries recorded for retry

3. **Privacy**
   - User preferences respected
   - Sensitive information sanitized
   - Opt-out options available

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Notification delivery metrics
   - User engagement tracking
   - Channel effectiveness analysis

2. **Advanced Targeting**
   - Machine learning for job matching
   - Predictive mentorship matching
   - Behavioral notification timing

3. **Rich Notifications**
