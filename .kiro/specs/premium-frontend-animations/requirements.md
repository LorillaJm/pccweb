# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the frontend user experience into a premium, world-class interface with sophisticated animations, microinteractions, and page transitions. The implementation focuses on creating a visually stunning yet performant experience that guides user attention through purposeful motion, maintains accessibility standards, and ensures smooth performance on mid-range mobile devices (50-60 FPS target). The scope includes the main public-facing pages: Home, About, Programs, Admissions, News & Events, and Contact.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hero Morphing Animation with Parallax

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an engaging animated hero section when I land on the homepage, so that I immediately perceive the platform as modern and premium.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the system SHALL display a morphing blob animation with subtle parallax effects in the hero section

5. WHEN multiple cards are present THEN the system SHALL ensure hover animations don't cause layout shifts
6. IF the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled THEN the system SHALL use subtle opacity or border changes instead of transforms

### Requirement 4: Page Transitions with Framer Motion

**User Story:** As a visitor navigating between pages, I want smooth, cohesive transitions that maintain visual continuity, so that the experience feels like a single fluid application rather than disconnected pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a new page THEN the system SHALL animate content with fade and slide transitions
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL implement shared element morphing for common elements
3. WHEN a page transition occurs THEN the system SHALL use Framer Motion library for animation orchestration
4. WHEN transitioning THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance on desktop devices
5. WHEN transitioning THEN the system SHALL maintain 50-60 FPS performance on mid-range mobile devices
6. IF the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled THEN the system SHALL use instant page changes or simple fades

### Requirement 5: Full-Screen Loading Mask

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a polished loading animation instead of layout shifts and content popping in, so that the experience feels premium and intentional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is loading THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen animated loading mask
2. WHEN content is ready THEN the system SHALL morph the loading mask into the actual page content
3. WHEN the loading mask animates THEN the system SHALL hide any layout shifts or content reflows
4. WHEN the loading transition completes THEN the system SHALL ensure no flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
5. WHEN the loading mask displays THEN the system SHALL use brand colors and maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and Reduced Motion Support

**User Story:** As a visitor with motion sensitivity or using assistive technology, I want to experience the interface without disorienting animations and with proper keyboard navigation, so that I can use the platform comfortably and effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled THEN the system SHALL respect this preference across all animations
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL display clear, high-contrast focus indicators on all interactive elements
3. WHEN focus indicators appear THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (minimum 3:1)
4. WHEN animations are disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain all functionality with instant state changes
5. WHEN the user navigates via keyboard THEN the system SHALL ensure logical tab order through all interactive elements
6. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels for animated elements

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a visitor on a mid-range mobile device, I want the interface to feel smooth and responsive, so that I can navigate and interact without lag or jank.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations run THEN the system SHALL achieve 60 FPS on desktop devices
2. WHEN animations run on mobile THEN the system SHALL achieve 50-60 FPS on mid-range devices
3. WHEN animating THEN the system SHALL only use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
4. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL avoid layout thrashing and forced reflows
5. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL have Lighthouse performance score above 90
6. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL verify performance on common mid-range devices (e.g., mid-tier Android phones)

### Requirement 8: High-Contrast Design System
