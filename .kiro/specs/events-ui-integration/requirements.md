# Events & Tickets UI Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QR-based event ticketing system has been fully implemented with comprehensive backend services, frontend components, and admin interfaces. However, the events and tickets functionality is not visible or accessible to end users through the main portal dashboards. Users cannot easily discover, register for events, or view their tickets because these features are not integrated into the primary user interface.

This feature will integrate the existing events and tickets functionality into the main portal dashboards and navigation, making the system discoverable and usable for all user roles.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a student has registered tickets THEN the system SHALL display a "My Tickets" section showing their active tickets with QR codes
3. WHEN a student clicks on an event THEN the system SHALL navigate to the event registration page
