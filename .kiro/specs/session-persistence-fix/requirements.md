# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing authentication issues where users receive 401 errors when the system attempts to verify their current authentication status. This occurs during the initial app load when `getCurrentUser` is called, indicating problems with session persistence and authentication state management. The system needs reliable session handling that maintains user authentication across browser sessions and handles authentication failures gracefully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store session information that persists across browser restarts
2. WHEN a user returns to the application within the session timeout period THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them without requiring re-login
3. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the expiration and redirect to login
4. IF a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state if the session is still valid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle authentication errors gracefully, so that I'm not stuck in error states or infinite loading loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a 401 error during authentication check THEN it SHALL clear the current user state and redirect to login
2. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a maximum number of attempts
3. WHEN authentication check fails permanently THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow manual retry
4. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an offline state rather than continuous loading

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust session management on the backend, so that authentication state is properly maintained and validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the backend SHALL create a secure session with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN a session request is made THEN the backend SHALL validate the session and return appropriate status codes
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the backend SHALL return 401 status and clear the session
4. IF session data is corrupted or invalid THEN the backend SHALL handle it gracefully and return 401

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about my authentication status, so that I understand whether I'm logged in or need to authenticate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is checking authentication THEN it SHALL show a loading state
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the authenticated user interface
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show the login interface with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN there are authentication errors THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages to guide user action
