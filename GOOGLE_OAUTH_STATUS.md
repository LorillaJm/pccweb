# 🔐 Google OAuth Status & Troubleshooting

## ✅ What's Been Fixed:

### Backend Changes:
1. ✅ OAuth callback generates JWT tokens
2. ✅ `/auth/me` endpoint supports both JWT and sessions
3. ✅ CORS configured for production frontend
4. ✅ Session cookies configured for cross-domain

### Frontend Changes:
1. ✅ OAuth buttons point to production backend
2. ✅ API interceptor includes JWT tokens from localStorage
3. ✅ Callback page stores tokens and redirects

## 🎯 Current Status:

**Local Development**: ✅ WORKING
**Production**: ⏳ Should work after deployments complete

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps:

### Step 1: Verify Render Deployment
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Check status - should say "Live" (not "Deploying")
4. Check the commit hash - should be `e7711ef`
5. If still deploying, wait for it to finish

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Deployment
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Check latest deployment status - should be "Ready"
4. Check the commit hash - should be `1dc8a65` or later
5. If still building, wait for it to finish

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
Even after deployments finish, your browser might cache old code:

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Option B: Incognito/Private Window**
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Test Google OAuth there

**Option C: Clear localStorage**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Click "Clear site data"
4. Refresh page

### Step 4: Test the Flow
1. Go to: https://pccweb-a46e-az5tvay2o-lorillajms-projects.vercel.app/auth/login
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Select your Google account
4. Should redirect to `/auth/callback`
5. Should show "Successfully authenticated"
6. Should redirect to `/portal/student`
7. Should stay logged in (not redirect back to login)

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working:

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors when clicking Google login
4. Look for errors after redirect

### Check Network Tab:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click Google login
4. Look for the `/api/auth/me` request
5. Check if it includes `Authorization: Bearer xxx` header
6. Check the response - should be 200 with user data, not 401

### Check localStorage:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Click "Local Storage"
4. Check if `accessToken` and `refreshToken` exist
5. If missing, the callback page didn't store them

### Check Render Logs:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click your backend service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Try Google login
5. Look for:
   ```
   Google OAuth profile received: {...}
   Existing Google user found: ...
   ```
6. Should NOT see any errors

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior:

### Successful Flow:
```
1. Click "Continue with Google"
   → Redirects to: https://pccweb.onrender.com/api/auth/google

2. Google authentication
   → Redirects to: https://pccweb.onrender.com/api/auth/google/callback

3. Backend generates tokens
   → Redirects to: https://your-frontend.vercel.app/auth/callback?token=xxx&refresh=yyy

4. Frontend stores tokens
   → localStorage.setItem('accessToken', xxx)
   → localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', yyy)

5. Frontend redirects
   → window.location.href = '/portal/student'

6. Portal page loads
   → Calls /api/auth/me with Authorization: Bearer xxx
   → Gets user data
   → Stays on portal page ✅
```

### Failed Flow (What You're Seeing):
```
1-5. Same as above ✅

6. Portal page loads
   → Calls /api/auth/me
   → Gets 401 Unauthorized ❌
   → Redirects back to login ❌
```

## 🔧 Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Force Render Redeploy
If Render didn't auto-deploy:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

### Fix 2: Force Vercel Redeploy
If Vercel didn't auto-deploy:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "..." on latest → "Redeploy"

### Fix 3: Test with cURL
Test if backend accepts JWT:
```bash
# Get a token first by doing Google OAuth
# Then test:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  https://pccweb.onrender.com/api/auth/me
```

Should return user data, not 401.

## ✅ Verification Checklist:

- [ ] Render shows "Live" status
- [ ] Render commit is `e7711ef` or later
- [ ] Vercel shows "Ready" status
- [ ] Vercel commit is `1dc8a65` or later
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] localStorage has `accessToken` after OAuth
- [ ] `/api/auth/me` request includes `Authorization` header
- [ ] `/api/auth/me` returns 200 (not 401)
- [ ] Portal page doesn't redirect to login

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

When it's working, you'll see:
1. ✅ Google OAuth completes
2. ✅ Brief "Successfully authenticated" message
3. ✅ Redirects to portal
4. ✅ Portal loads with your data
5. ✅ Stays on portal (doesn't redirect)
6. ✅ Can navigate around the app
7. ✅ Refresh page and still logged in

---

## 💡 Why It Works Locally:

Local development works because:
- Frontend and backend are on same domain (localhost)
- No cross-domain cookie issues
- No deployment delays
- No caching issues
- Instant code changes

Production requires:
- Proper JWT token handling (✅ implemented)
- Cross-domain authentication (✅ implemented)
- Waiting for deployments (⏳ in progress)
- Cache clearing (🔄 manual step)

---

## 📞 Next Steps:

1. **Wait** for both Render and Vercel to finish deploying
2. **Clear** browser cache completely
3. **Test** in incognito window
4. **Check** browser console for errors
5. **Verify** localStorage has tokens
6. **Should work!** 🎉

If still not working after all deployments are complete and cache is cleared, check the Render logs for the actual error message.
